### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello !! My name is Joyoshish Saha. I'm a passionate Deep Learning and Machine Learning practitioner and I am always eager to learn new technologies. I like to experiment with new Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries and use them to make cool projects. I write articles on Deep Learning in different platforms like Quora and Medium. Among my recent obsessions is the OpenAI's GPT-3 and it's fascinating for me what this language model can achieve. I idolize great personalities like Geoffrey Hinton, Ian J. Goodfellow and I really fantacize to meet them one day ðŸ˜Š.  
Currently I am in my senior year of Information Technology bachelors degree program in Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur. I aspire to work on meaningful works that have some direct impact on people's lives.
